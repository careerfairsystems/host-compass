# Host Compass
The Host Compass used during the Host Recruitment for students who don't really know what they should apply for in ARKAD.
The questions can easily be changed for future career fairs.
Please note that you can't create more than one JS, HTML and CSS file as this is supposed to be uploaded in the ARKAD website using Squarespace embedded code.

If you have questions please contact the Frontend Manager of 2023, [Andr√© Frisk](https://github.com/Stronkness)
